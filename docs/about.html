          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a student at McGill University with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Philosophy!
          </p>
          <p>
            I love to create things so some of my hobbies are: 3D modelling and printing, environment design, 2D animation, graphic design, and working with ink and paint. 
          </p>
          <p>In my spare time, I like to play video games. Some of my favourite games are Stray, Valheim, and Stardew Valley. I have also captained and competed competitively for the main McGill Valorant team!
